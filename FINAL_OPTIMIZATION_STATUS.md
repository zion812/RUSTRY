```

#### 2. **Repository Optimization**
```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts - Reliable sources configured
repositories {
    google()                                    # ✅ Primary Android
    mavenCentral()                             # ✅ Primary Maven  
    maven("https://repo.spring.io/milestone")  # ✅ Reliable mirror
    maven("https://jitpack.io")                # ✅ GitHub packages
}
```

#### 3. **Dependency Management**
```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts - BOM-based versioning
implementation(platform(libs.androidx.compose.bom))  # ✅ Version consistency
implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended")  # ✅ No manual versions
implementation("androidx.compose.animation:animation")               # ✅ BOM-managed
```

### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis: Complex Project Structure**

#### **Primary Challenge Identified**
The RUSTRY project has an extremely complex dependency structure that causes extended build times:

1. **50+ Dependencies**: Firebase, Compose, Room, WorkManager, etc.
2. **Multiple Build Variants**: Debug, Release, Benchmark
3. **Complex Configuration**: Extensive build logic and optimizations
4. **Large Transitive Dependency Tree**: Hundreds of indirect dependencies

#### **Performance Bottlenecks**
- **Dependency Resolution**: Complex version resolution algorithms
- **Configuration Phase**: Extensive build script evaluation
- **Plugin Application**: Multiple Gradle plugins with complex interactions
- **Network Calls**: Large number of repository queries
